    "Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be regarded as a simple concatenation (and parallelization) of several perceptrons, each having a specified activation function $\\sigma$ and a set of weights $\\mathbf{w}_{ij}$. The idea that this can be done was discovered early after the invention of the perceptron, but people didn't really use it in practice because nobody really knew how to figure out the appropriate $\\mathbf{w}_{ij}$. The solution to this problem was the discovery of the backpropagation algorithm which consists of two steps: first propagating the input forward through the layers of the MLP and storing the intermediate results and then propagating the error backwards and adjusting the weights of the units accordingly.\n",

The rules for the intermediate layers can be derived very similarly and only require a slight shift in perspective - the mathematics for that are however not in the standard toolkit so we are going to omit the calculations and refer you to the lecture slides."

This is a real problem in data mining problems, where for a higher number of features, the number of possible combinations and therefore the volume of the resulting feature space exponentionally increases.\n",

This also leads to the problem that pairs of data vectors have a high probability of having similar distances and to be close to orthogonal to each other. The result is that clustering becomes really difficult, as the vectors more or less stand on their own and distance measures cannot be applied easily."

There is not much trend in the plot which is what we desired, i.e. the axis are not redundant. No clusters can be recognized. It is admissible to pick a subspace of dimension two since the eigenvectors have negligible magnitude starting at the third eigenvector. PCA is a good method for this dataset.\n",

This allows us to interpret the first graph better. Cars that are far on the right must have a high gas mileage, either in the city, on the highway or both. They do not have high values on the other categories though. Cars that are high up in the plot are expensive and have high horse power but are rather small and don't weigh much.\n",

    "## Assignment 3: Eigenfaces [6 Points]\n",
    "\n",
    "A very famous example of applying PCA to solve classification problems are Eigenfaces. It employs PCA to project training images of faces into the Eigenspace to reduce the dimensionality of those images by a few magnitudes. To classify test images they are projected into the Eigenspace and the (euclidean) distance between the sample and each reduced training image is calculated - the closest training image wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid problems with your own implementation of PCA in assignment 2 you will now rely on the `scipy` package which already provides an implementation of PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will implement the Eigenfaces algorithm and apply it to a subset of the [Extended Yale Face Database B](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/FaceData.html) (the subset of files is stored in `eigenfaces.zip`). Then you will apply the same procedure to another data set, [leafsnap](http://leafsnap.com/dataset/) (`leafsnap.zip`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The face dataset is provided in two sets (`eigenfaces/train` and `eigenfaces/test`) which each yield four images per each of five different people in the [pgm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) format (which is supported by `matplotlib` via `pillow`). \n",
    "The leafsnap dataset is provided in two sets as well (`leafsnap/train` and `leafsnap/test`) which each contain two images of leaves from 184 different tree species. They were automatically cropped to square images, resized to a resolution of 200x200 pixels and converted to the [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) format.\n"

    "Usually a grayscale image is seen as a set of pixels each being a three dimensional datapoint consisting of features X coordinate, Y coordinate and gray value.

    "To make this a little bit more clear, consider the 2x2 binary images (see the plot below). Each image is one out of 16 possible data points in the space of all possible 2x2 binary images. The space has four dimensions with two possible values in each, so there are $2^4=16$ possible images. They can be described as feature vectors: \n",

Now find a (unit) vector $\\vec{p}_m$, orthogonal to the existing vectors $\\vec{p}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{p}_{m-1}$, that maximizes the projected variance $\\vec{p}_m^TC\\vec{p}_m$. Proceed similar to case (a), but with additional Lagrangian multipliers to enforce the orthogonality constraint. Show that the new vector $\\vec{p}_m$ is an eigenvector of $C$.

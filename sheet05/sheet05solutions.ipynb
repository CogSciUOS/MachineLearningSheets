    "In such a high dimensional space, data vectors from real data sets lie far away from each other (which means dense sampling becomes impossible, as there aren't enough samples close to each other). This also leads to the problem that pairs of data vectors have a high probability of having similar distances and to be close to orthogonal to each other.

    "The first plot shows the complete dataset projected down onto the two first principle components. Only few points overlap and the points are generally spread out well in the subspace. There is not much trend in the plot which is what we desired, i.e. the axis are not redundant. No clusters can be recognized. It is admissible to pick a subspace of dimension two since the eigenvectors have negligible magnitude starting at the third eigenvector. PCA is a good method for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot shows where a car that has a unit vector as a feature vector would be projected into the subspace. Two custers are recognizable - the gas milage and the other features. This allows us to interpret the first graph better. Cars that are far on the right must have a high gas mileage, either in the city, on the highway or both. They do not have high values on the other categories though. Cars that are high up in the plot are expensive and have high horse power but are rather small and don't weigh much.\n",

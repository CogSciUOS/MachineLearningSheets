    "### Algorithm: Multilayer Perceptron with Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "We try to follow the definitions from the lecture (ML-07, Slide 46) closely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Layers are numbered from $0$ (input layer) to $L_H + 1$ (output layer), such that $1 \\dots L_H$ are hidden layers.\n",
    "* Each layer has $N(i)$ neurons, numbered from $1 \\dots N(i)$.\n",
    "* $o_i(k)$ is the output of neuron $i$ in layer $k$.\n",
    "* $w_{ik}(m,n)$ is the weight between neuron $i$ in layer $m$ and neuron $k$ in layer $n$ (where for our case $m = n + 1$ holds).\n",
    "* The input to the MLP is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{in}} = o(0)$, the output is $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{out}} = o(L_H + 1)$.\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm you have to implement is now as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize your MLP.** Use as many input neurons as there are dimensions in the data. Input neurons always expect 1D input. Then create neurons for each hidden and the output layer. Each neuron in the hidden and output layers expects as many inputs as there are neurons in the layer before them.\n",
    "1. **Initialize the neurons' weights.** For each neuron in layers $1 \\dots L_H + 1$ initialize the weights to small random values (values between $0$ and $1$ are fine, but you are allowed to tweak the numbers around).\n",
    "1. **Implement the activation (feed-forward) step.**\n",
    "    1. Decompose the input into its components and pass them to the correct input neuron.\n",
    "    1. Each input neuron passes its unprocessed input to the next layer. That means each neuron in layer $1$ receives all outputs from each input layer as its own input.\n",
    "    $$o_i(0) = x_i$$\n",
    "    1. Calculate the weighted sums of their inputs and apply their activation function $\\sigma$ for each neuron in the layers $1 \\dots L_H + 1$. This is best done iteratively layer by layer, as each layer's input is the output of its preceding layer (Note: $w_{j0}(k,k)$ denotes the bias for neuron $j$ in layer $k$):\n",
    "    $$\\begin{align*}\n",

    "    $$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp{(-x)}}$$\n",
    "    1. The resulting $o_i(L_H+1)$ are the outputs $y_i$ for each output neuron $i$.\n",
    "1. **Implement the adaption (backpropagation) step.**\n",
    "    1. Compute the error between the target and output components to calculate the error signals $\\delta_i(L_H+1)$:\n",
    "    $$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "      \\delta_i(L_H + 1) &= o_i(L_H+1)\\ (1 - o_i(L_H+1))\\ (t_i - o_i(L_H + 1))\n",
    "    \\end{align*}$$\n",

    "    \\delta_i(k) &= o_i(k)\\ (1 - o_i(k))\\ \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N(k+1)} w_{ji}(k+1,k)\\delta_j(k+1)\n",

    "We will basically take a bottom-up approach: Starting from an individual **perceptron** (or neruon), over a **layer of perceptrons** to a **multilayer perceptron** (or nerual network). Each of the 3 will be implemented as its own python *class*. Such a class basically defines a type of element, as a perceptron, which can be instantiated multiple times. You can think of such an instance as an individuum of a population (defined by a specific class). Each instance has specific methods which can be used to modify it -- again, taking the population reference, each puppy of the *puppy population* has the method *make_puppy_face()*.\n",

    "This exercise is aimed at deepening the understanding of Radial Basis Function Networks and how they relate to Multilayer Perceptrons. Not all of the answers can be found directly in the slides - so when answering the (more algorithmic) questions, first take a minute and think about how you would go about solving them and if nothing comes to mind search the internet for a little bit. If you are interested in a real life application of both algorithms and how they compare take a look at this paper: [Comparison between Multi-Layer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Networks for Sediment Load Estimation in a Tropical Watershed](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JWARP20121000014_80441700.pdf)\n",
